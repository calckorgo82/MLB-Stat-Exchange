### Hello! Welcome to Danny's MLB Stat Exchange! 

This project was motivated by my passion for baseball. As a sports fanatic and a numbers tpye of guy, I wanted to create a program where I am able to query for MLB data without having to go through pages of baseball reference or other sports stat site. I used an extremely useful library called, "statsapi," which is a library that makes api calls to deliver real type sports statistics. With the help of this library, I was able to make a bunch of functions that used the user's input to give the baseball statistic that they want. Here are some of the functions:

<ol>
  <li>Career Stats</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Displays a player's all-time hitting, pitching, or fielding stats (active and not active)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Career Leaders</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Displays a top leaders in the different hitting and pitching stats (i.e. home runs, strikeouts, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>League Standings</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Displays league standings at a given date</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Current Player Stats</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Displays an active player's current season hitting, pitching, or fielding stats</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Last Game</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Displays a team's last game's box score or links to video highlights.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Team Rosters</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Displays a current team's roster</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

I think this project will be very helpful for me throughout the season, as I keep up with my favorite team, the New York Yankees. Hopefully later on, I will be able to add more functions to make a more robust statistical exchange program.
