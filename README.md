# cs32-final-project

This project will entail a program where you will be able to query for baseball statistics with APIs. By using the library "statsapi", I am using user input to query for baseball data that the user wants. A few of the multiple functions that I am implementing are career stats, all-time league leaders, current standings, and more to come.

A way to use the data query program is to specify which type of data you want. For example, if we were to want all-time league leaders for a certain statistic, you would specify which stat and how many top players you want to view. Then, the output is a list of the stat queried for, along with the player's name and team name.
